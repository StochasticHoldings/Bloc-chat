Hello Colby!

This is michael, we talked briefly at the code and beer meetup at Substantial last week... I just checked out your project, looked at the code base and I really liked the feature... You had mentioned you need work on this, and want to add this feature to your business...

I am interested in helping out for a price, but I regret to inform you that I am not interested in taking the time to learn Angular right now. My proposal to you is to build a chat app from scratch in React that is scalable, fast as hell, (i'm not sure how state is handled in Angular, but in React only functional programming is allowed)

Again I am full stack, so making this mobile friendly and looking great is a big concern of mine... I am clarifying mobile responsive for WEBSITE display, If you want an iPhone or android app, that is a different project altogether :)

I am not sure how this would be possible, as you mentioned the rest of your e commerce site is built in PHP, and this sounds almost like a separate part of the site... This would be something to investigate and research... (Shouldn't be a big problem, but is something to think about)

I am breezing over specifically what I can do, but if you are interested in starting from scratch on something that I know I can do correctly from start to finish, let me know. My email is axelmichael11@gmail.com please shoot me a message there if and we could talk more about the project...

Thanks!
Michael
